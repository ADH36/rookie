## !IMPORTANT!

This app may be buggy and have problems, I will recode it from scratch ~~when MAUI will be released (This september) and a linux port will be available, making RSL cross-platform.~~
Since microsoft delayed MAUI and they don't support linux, I decided to try to rewrite it in go, a language that I started learning recently, so there is no ETA for that.

### This app might get detected as malware, however both the sideloader and the sideloader launcher are open source
