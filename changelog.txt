RSL 2.9.2

+ Added option in settings menu
to automatically reinstall apps
when installs fail due to previous
version clashing with update.

NOTE: If your USB or wireless ADB
connection is extremely slow this
setting can cause larger APK installs
to fail in rare cases.

= Fixed auto reinstall for signature
mismatch when if ADB reports error
properly (thanks to ADB update),
this will lead to faster reinstalls
in general when there are issues.

= Fixed crash that would occur when 
closing Rookie.

= Added check to see if AAPT was 
sucessful in retrieving mew game 
name from APK, if not RSL will just 
call the name by its package name 
instead.
