RSL 2.9.3

+ Added new background color for apps that are a newer
version than the version on the list. If you see this
darker background please agree to share when prompted
upon program launch or alternatively select the game 
from top drop-down installed apps list and click Share 
Selected App to help the community!

+ Added logic for file size column, clicking the column
header will now properly sort from biggest to smallest
or vice versa.

= Fixed issue where Rookie would ask for every single
app installed on user's device. It should now only ask
for apps not on Rookie and not on the Blacklist as
intended.

= Changed zip file naming for new game uploads to use 
Release Name instead of package name.
