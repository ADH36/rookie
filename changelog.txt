text file to ensure all users are on newest ADB, 
this should fix most obb issues. Upon first launch
after this update Rookie will automatically obtain
the latest ADB via this zip (7MB).

detect packagename for automatic reinstall when drag 
and dropped installs fail.

failure for Download and Install, it should work for
most users now.

to load gameslist whatsoever on dead mirrors.

ask user to donate same clean files again. RSL will now
only ask once per program load, as intended.
