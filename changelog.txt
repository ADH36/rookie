
RSL 2.8.2 

+ Added automatic upload to Google shared drive
for clean game files donation.
+ Added uploading GIF for duration of upload.
+ Added warning messages when user attempts
to close Rookie while games are download, installing,
or uploading.
= Threaded clean file zipping and uploading
so user can continue to use Rookie while game
is uploading.


P.S. We are looking for volunteers for the next
beta which will automatically detect new games
installed on user's headset and suggest them for
donation. Message https://t.me/Harryeffinpotter or 
https://t.me/pmowpmow on Telegram to join the beta 
test!
