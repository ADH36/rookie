+ Added No Device mode for those who wish to download games 
overnight without interruption.
+ Added automatic config update at launch.
+ Added a unique HWID generator that will generate a unique 
number based on your  PC's components and then encrypt it
with SHA256. This is so donors can be anonymously identified 
for the purpose of future benefits/recognition. Once.the HWID 
is generated RSL then creates  a text file named HWID to put 
with the  clean files in the zip. Users can see their unique 
HWID at any time by pressing CTRL+H  in Rookie. Your unique HWID 
will always be the same.
= Added version code to any zip files created during clean files

RSL 2.5.1

+ Added PARTIAL SEARCH compatibility to Quick Search. Quick 
Search now works if users type one word or one part of a word 
that matches a release. For example if an app was named 
"Supercool Awesome Application", typing "Application", 
"Awesome", or even "Cool" would work as it works with parts of 
words as well. 

NOTE:As a reminder you can open Quick Search with F2, CTRL+F 
or by cllicking on the Quick Search magnifying glass icon.

+ Added a blocklist for apps that can't be updated for various 
reasons. This will prevent users from being asked to send apps 
that cannot be used.
+ Added .png support for gameslist thumbnails.
+ Added tip under Notes section at launch to remind users they 
can press F1 to view all of the program shortcuts added in a 
prior update. 
= Some minor syntax updates.

RSL 2.5

+ Upgraded Extract APK from device to Extract APP to Desktop. 
RSL will now automatically extract the APK file, then extract 
the obb if there is any for the selected app, then it will 
compress both into a zip file and place it on the desktop so 
users can share their apps without issue.
+ Added automatic detection of apps that are more updated than 
the database user is connecting to, and if they are a pop up 
will ask if user wants to share the app.
= Fixed issue where copying a folder containing an obb folder 
via drag and drop would cause the containing folder to be copied 
to the obb folder as well.
= Changelog.txt now only contains the 3 most recent updates 
including the most current, the older changelogs can be found 
in the ChangelogHistory text file.
