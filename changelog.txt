RSL 2.8.5

+ Added OPT-IN installed packages check,
this will be used to add common free apps
to a blacklist so a future version of RSL 
can ask users to donate new apps.

= Fixed logic for apk signature mismatch
automatic reinstall.

= Increased timer for apk installation
failure to 3 minutes.

= Fixed blacklist implementation for 
updates to apps already on RSL.

- Removed 2nd confirmation dialog for 
app uninstalls.
