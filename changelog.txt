RSL 2.10.2

= Fixed issue where same new apps were being 
asked for before 72 hr window if not marked as 
free..
= Changed 7zip compression level to Store for
faster zipping for donations (since apks are
already compressed the file size only changes
1-2MB at most, so upload time will be virtually 
the same).
