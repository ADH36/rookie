RSL 2.9.4 

= Changed install.txt logic to search
for any .7z files and use Zip Extract
function from GeneralUtilities, should
fix version issues with users who have
a newer 7zip installed than the 7zip
exe included with install.txt games.

= Fully moved ADB folder to 
C:\RSL\platform-rools and removed
adb folder from Rookie directory.
Rookie will do this automatically upon 
first launch after updating. This will 
make updating to future versions of ADB 
much smoother. This should also fix issues 
caused by having multiple version of
adb.exe clashing and fix AAPT issues as 
well.

= Updated 7z.exe and 7z.dll on Github.
